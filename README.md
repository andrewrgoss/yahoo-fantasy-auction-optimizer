## Yahoo fantasy football auction draft optimizer
Binary integer programming to optimize strategies for drafts using Yahoo fantasy football point projections and predraft auction values.

In R, run the binary_integer_program.R file to compute the optimal team. I changed the roster settings at the top of the file to reflect league settings. 
I also edited the full PPR data .csv file to change the projections according to Yahoo valuations and point projections. Inside the R script, the optimal team is printed to console.
